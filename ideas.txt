Drone something
IOT (Smart home):
    use alexa or google home with raspi or arduino to control things
        lights on/off
        hue lights
        LED strip things?
            maybe an LED cube
        blinds/curtain
        doors and things?
    could make it life size with demos
    could instead make a mini model house
        pros:
            cheaper
            easier
        cons:
            not as cool

We might not even need to use an alexa or google home if we don't want to
    google ML has speech recognition and audio response
    we can train it to recognize and respond to specific commands
        cheaper
        can emulate alexa features, which would be cool
        might end up wasting time on this instead of just using an alexa


Joel mentioned whatever we do should have audience engagement if we
want to win prizes

Can we please do more software than hardware
